# KNIRVBASE (Go)

✅ **Overview**

KNIRVBASE is a lightweight, local-first distributed database prototype implemented in Go. It demonstrates a minimal, self-contained implementation of:

- **PQC Encryption Layer**: Post-quantum cryptography using Kyber-768 (encryption) and Dilithium-3 (signatures) for secure data storage
- CRDT-based conflict resolution using **vector clocks**,
- Local file-backed **storage** for metadata and blobs (blobs are stored locally),
- **Real P2P networking** with DHT-like peer discovery and TCP-based communication,
- A small, human-friendly query language **KNIRVQL** for simple GET/SET/DELETE and basic vector similarity queries.

This package is intended as an architectural prototype and reference implementation for distributed collections and synchronization logic used across the KNIRV ecosystem.

## 🔍 Features

- **PQC Encryption at Rest**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data using Kyber-768 KEM + AES-256-GCM, with Dilithium-3 signatures for integrity
- Local-first operations and background sync
- CRDT resolve using vector clocks (merge rules + LWW tie-breakers)
- File-based storage for documents and local blob files
- **Real P2P networking** with TCP connections and DHT-like peer discovery
- `KNIRVQL` parser and executor for quick interactive operations
- Convenience command-line demo in `cmd/main.go`

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 (see `go.mod`) — ensure your toolchain matches or is compatible: `go version`

### Build

```bash
make build
# or
go build -o ./bin/knirvbase ./cmd
```

### Run

The binary stores data in your OS application data directory by default. On Linux it uses `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or falls back to `~/.local/share/knirvbase`.

```bash
./bin/knirvbase
```

The included `cmd/main.go` file demonstrates:

- Creating a distributed database instance
- Creating/joining a network
- Creating two collections: `auth` and `memory`
- Example `KNIRVQL` usage to `SET` and `GET` authentication keys
- Inserting a `MEMORY` entry with a vector payload and querying via similarity

Press Ctrl+C to exit the running demo.

## 📁 Storage Layout

- Data directory (default): `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or `~/.local/share/knirvbase`
- Per-collection JSON files: `<datadir>/<collection>/<id>.json`
- Blobs (for `MEMORY` entries) are saved under `<datadir>/<collection>/blobs/<id>` and are not automatically synchronized across peers — only metadata and vectors are synchronized.

Why blobs are not synced: to preserve network bandwidth and storage efficiency. The system synchronizes discovery metadata (including blob references) rather than raw blobs.

---

## 🧭 KNIRVQL (Query Language) — Examples

- Set an auth key:

```knirvql
SET google_maps_api_key = "AIzaSy..."
```

- Get an auth key:

```knirvql
GET AUTH WHERE key = "google_maps_api_key"
```

- Insert a memory item (demonstrated programmatically in `cmd/main.go`)

- Get similar memory entries (vector search):

```knirvql
GET MEMORY WHERE source = "web-scrape" SIMILAR TO [0.45, 0.12] LIMIT 10
```

The language is intentionally minimal and aimed at quick integration and demos — for production you will likely expose richer query primitives or integrate with a dedicated vector index.

- `internal/collection` — `DistributedCollection` + `LocalCollection`: local storage, CRDT operation emission, sync logic.
- `internal/storage` — `FileStorage`: file-based persistence and blob handling with PQC encryption.
- `internal/network` — `Network` interface + `NetworkManager`: real P2P networking with TCP connections and DHT-like peer discovery.
- `internal/resolver` — CRDT resolver logic and helpers for converting to/from distributed documents.
- `internal/clock` — vector clock implementation and comparison utilities.
- `internal/query` — `KNIRVQL` parser and query execution.
- `internal/types` — core types (Document, CRDTOperation, NetworkConfig, ProtocolMessage, etc.)

## 🛠 Development & Testing

- Run tests (where present):

```bash
go test ./...
```

- Run performance benchmarks:

```bash
make bench
# or
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./internal/benchmarks
```

- Run SLA validation tests:

```bash
make bench-sla
# or
go test -run=TestBenchmarkSLAs -v ./internal/benchmarks

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

KNIRVBASE includes a comprehensive benchmark suite that validates performance against ASIC-Shield SLA requirements:

### SLA Targets (ASIC-Shield Integration)
- **Credential Insert**: p99 < 10ms
- **Credential Query**: p99 < 5ms
- **Authentication Workflow**: p99 < 500ms (including 100M KDF iterations)
- **PQC Encryption**: < 20ms per operation
- **Large Scale**: No performance degradation with 10K+ credentials

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
make bench-all

# Run SLA validation
make bench-sla

# Generate CPU/memory profiles
make bench-profile
```

### Benchmark Results

The benchmark suite (`benchmarks_test.go`) includes:
- `BenchmarkCredentialInsert`: Measures credential storage performance
- `BenchmarkCredentialQuery`: Measures credential lookup performance
- `BenchmarkPQCCrypto`: Measures PQC encryption/decryption overhead
- `BenchmarkAuthWorkflow`: Simulates full authentication workflow
- `BenchmarkLargeScale`: Tests performance with 10K credentials

Integration tests (`benchmark_integration_test.go`) validate that results meet SLA targets and detect performance regressions.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Security Notes

- **PQC Encryption at Rest:** Field-level encryption for all sensitive data across collections (`credentials`, `pqc_keys`, `sessions`, `audit_log`, `threat_events`, `access_control`). Encrypts specific fields like `hash`, `salt`, `token_hash`, `details`, `indicators`, `permissions`, etc. Uses Kyber-768 + AES-256-GCM for confidentiality and Dilithium-3 for integrity. Master key must be configured for encryption to be active.
- **P2P Networking:** Real TCP-based P2P networking with DHT-like peer discovery enables true distributed operation across multiple nodes.
- **Blob handling:** Blobs are stored locally and only referenced in synchronized metadata; no blob distribution is implemented here.
- **No authentication for network messages:** This prototype does not implement cryptographic signing or authenticated transports — real deployments must use TLS/Noise and authenticated peer identities.
